# create-air

A Forge mod that allows Create diving suits to be used whit Thin Air. When wearing a diving helmet and a tank with some air inside, that will be used instead of the player's air supply.
Requires Create and Thin Air.


-Copper Lungs (the original mod by jc776)

-Create (used for the diving gear)

-Thin Air (providing the oxygen mechanic)

 

Remaining air not displaying, and the status effect not being hidden, are issues I'm unable to solve, my Java is really rudimentary and if anyone has a fix, I'll be happy to implement it with credit.
