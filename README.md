A Forge mod that allows Create diving suits to be used with Thin Air. When wearing a diving helmet and a tank with some air inside, that will be used instead of the player's air supply.
Requires Create and Thin Air.

-[Copper Lungs](https://modrinth.com/mod/copper-lungs) (the original mod by jc776)

-[Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) (used for the diving gear)

-[Thin Air](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/new-thin-air) (providing the oxygen mechanic)

Remaining air not displaying, and the status effect not being hidden, are issues I'm unable to solve, my Java is really rudimentary and if anyone has a fix, I'll be happy to implement it with credit.
